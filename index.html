            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                Our workshop aims to bring together researchers from different facets of Artificial Intelligence, from Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, to Embodied Intelligence and explore problems related to how AI technologies can be used to assist and empower users in their daily lives through a user-centric and problem driven manner.
            </p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                With the large advancement in AI and ML, there is a lot of excitement for the potential for these technologies to enhance and improve our daily lives. However, these solutions are often basic research and their usability is limited by the scale and nuance in applying the technology in daily life problems. The deployment of these systems for daily life problems require not only various expertise across AI such as ML and NLP, but also experts in the problem and domain space. For instance, a simple medication tracker app can be supercharged with advancement in various fields of AI to improve its usability and effectiveness. Besides simply checking medication intake, it can learn the pattern of intake, deploy various natural language strategies to encourage and remind user taking, and engage others in their care network to help and remind intake. This capability is only possible through the integration and synergistic collaboration between areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our workshop will attempt to bring together interested AI experts in different fields and share their experience and progress in using AI technologies to solve user’s daily problems. Through the workshop, we hope to not only connect and learn from experts in different fields but also share potential pitfalls when building these systems for budding researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The workshop will consist of various keynotes from renowned experts in their pursuit of applying AI technologies to challenging problems, and lightning talks from contributing participants in this subfield. We will also have emph amount of discussion time to allow participants to connect and build collaborations. We also intend to have a session for question driven solutions.
