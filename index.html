            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                Our workshop aims to bring together researchers from different facets of Artificial Intelligence, from Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, to Natural Language Processing and explore problems related to how AI technologies can be used to assist and empower users with at-home tasks through a user-centric and problem driven manner.
            </p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                With the advancement in AI and ML, there is a lot of excitement for the potential of these technologies to enhance and improve our daily lives. However, these solutions are often based on simplified formulation and abstracted datasets that make them challenging to be applied in complex and personalized household domains. Furthermore, any household solution will require not only expertise across algorithmic AI but also experts in interaction, socio technical issues, and problem space. For instance, a simple medication tracker app can be supercharged with advancement in various fields of AI to improve its usability and effectiveness. Besides simply checking medication intake, it can learn the pattern of intake, deploy various natural language strategies to encourage and remind user taking, and engage others in their care network to help and remind intake. This capability is only possible through the integration and synergistic collaboration between areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the topic of this workshop touches on so many different fields, its research community is spread out across different conferences. Our workshop is designed  to bring together interested AI experts that, while coming from different subfields, share the vision of using AI technologies to solve user problems at home. Participants of the workshop will have the opportunity to share their experience and progress in using AI technologies to assist and empower users at home as well as learn and engage with our expert speakers/panelists.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are planning a full-day hybrid workshop with a mix of keynote talks, contribution talks, and focused discussions. Our workshop will have a narrative where the morning portion of the program will discuss and talk about challenges at home and the vision of AI solutions. This will be followed by the afternoon session where we bring in various AI experts to discuss algorithmic approaches to various household problems and spark discussion on connecting AI technologies with real problems. We plan to end the workshop with a breakout session to discuss the pressing repeated questions that surfaced during the workshop.
